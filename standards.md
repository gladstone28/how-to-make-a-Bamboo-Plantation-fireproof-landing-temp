As of my last update in April 2023, there might not be specific local and international standards that directly apply to each of the 10 methods for fireproofing bamboo plantations, but there are broader standards and guidelines that could be relevant. Here's a general overview:

1. Regular Maintenance

Local Standards: Often governed by regional forestry or agricultural guidelines.
International Standards: Best practices in forestry management, such as those recommended by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations.

2. Irrigation and Moisture Control

Local Standards: Water usage and irrigation standards can be dictated by local water authorities or agricultural bodies.
International Standards: Guidelines by the World Bank or the International Irrigation Management Institute (IIMI) may apply.

3. Firebreaks

Local Standards: Local fire codes and forest management guidelines.
International Standards: International Wildland-Urban Interface Code (IWUIC) or guidelines by the United Nations International Strategy for Disaster Reduction (UNISDR).

4. Choice of Species

Local Standards: Often determined by agricultural or environmental agencies based on regional biodiversity.
International Standards: Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) guidelines for the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity.

5. Chemical Treatments

Local Standards: Subject to environmental protection laws and regulations on chemical usage.
International Standards: Guidelines from the International Code of Conduct on Pesticide Management.

6. Controlled Burning

Local Standards: Controlled or prescribed burning is usually regulated by local environmental and forestry agencies.
International Standards: Guidelines by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) for emissions and environmental impact.

7. Monitoring and Early Detection Systems

Local Standards: Determined by local fire codes and regulations.
International Standards: ISO standards for safety and emergency management, like ISO 31000 for risk management.

8. Training and Preparedness

Local Standards: Local occupational health and safety regulations.
International Standards: ISO 45001 for Occupational Health and Safety Management Systems.

9. Community Involvement

Local Standards: Typically governed by local government regulations on community engagement.
International Standards: UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly those related to community development and sustainable cities.

10. Research and Adaptation

Local Standards: Research standards are usually set by national science and technology policies.
International Standards: Guidelines by international research organizations such as the International Bamboo and Rattan Organisation (INBAR).
Remember, the applicability and enforcement of these standards can vary significantly depending on the country and region. It's essential to consult local authorities and experts in forestry and agricultural management for the most accurate and up-to-date information.
